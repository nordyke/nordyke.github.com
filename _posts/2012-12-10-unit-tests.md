*It’s soothing to write a unit test.*

It’s a breadcrumb to lead you back.

It’s a seat belt for when you crash.

It’s the opposite of free climbing.

Sometimes it feels like extra red tape. When you change your source code, the tests need to be adjusted. There are now two code bases to maintain. You might expose too much in an effort to have code coverage.

Come in from the wild, hacker. Unit tests are worth the red tape.
