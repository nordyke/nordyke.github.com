There are two types of front-end features of any web application. First, there are those that are necessary.  For these, you need to put in the extra work for them to function across supported devices and browsers.

Second, there are those that are icing on the cake.  They add to the experience, but they are not requisite for the app to function.

When you're dealing with feature icing, go all-or-nothing.  If the device supports the functionality necessary to make the feature some buttery awesomess, then use it.  If the device doesn't support the functionality necessary for greatness, don't create a lowest common denominator solution to satisfy it. Forget the feature.

Examples:

* Rounded corners
* Animations (CSS3 vs jQuery)
