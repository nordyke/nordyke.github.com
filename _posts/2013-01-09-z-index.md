I’m developing an application for a client in the form of overlays on top of their existing content.  Today, I was informed that our z-indexes are all too low.  The client’s site has elements that can go all the way up to 3000, and our elements were definitely below that.  They recommended we use a minimum of 4000 to be safe.

The most straightforward solution would be to find every z-index and add 4000 to it.

	.element { z-index: 50 }

becomes

	.element { z-index: 4050 }

But what happens if we we get a new requirement that our minimum should be 5000?  Do you really want to have to find all the z-indexes again? With SASS, this is a non-issue.

First, I created a new SASS variable to note my base z-index.

	$base-z-index: 4000;

Next, I added the variable to every z-index instance.

	.element { z-index: $base-z-index + 50; }

This also takes advantage of SASS’ built-in math operations.

Now, if the requirement changes, I only have to make one change to the stylesheets.
