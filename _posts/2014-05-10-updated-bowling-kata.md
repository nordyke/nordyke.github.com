I updated my [Bowling Kata Seed](https://github.com/nordyke/bowling-kata-seed) repo to use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) test runner, rather than its terribly-named former self, Testacular.  Instructions are in the README.

Bowling Kata Seed is a starter for practicing unit testing and test-driven development in JavaScript.
