<p>
	After a brief stint as a traveling consultant, the road wore me down,
	and I fell in love with making applications for the web.  The civilized society of desktop development is
	moving into the wild west of client-side web development, and it's a blast to be in the middle of the action.

<p>
	Currently, I am a Lead Application Developer at <a href="//www.vml.com">VML</a>, a digital agency in Kansas City.
